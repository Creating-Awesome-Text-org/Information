### What is a Large Language Model
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a form of Artificial Intelligence that is capable of generating human-like responses. 

It is build using deep learning techniques and utilizes a form of neural network known as a transformer. 
The transformer model enables efficient parallel analysis of text making it suitable for large scale issues. 

For further information on transformer models, please review the following article: [All You Need is Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)

LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn the statistical patterns and structures of human language. 
This training data often consists of a diverse range of sources, such as books, articles, websites, and more, allowing the model to gain a broad understanding of various language patterns and nuances.

LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding context, generating coherent responses, 
and even simulating human-like conversations. They have a wide range of applications across natural language 
processing (NLP) tasks and have significantly impacted the fields of AI research and applications. 
However, it's important to be aware that these models also raise ethical concerns related to misinformation, 
bias, privacy, and misuse, which researchers and developers actively work to address.
